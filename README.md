# ITM_transmit
 Advanced debugging and tracing capabilities in the microcontroller using STM32
 ITM (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell) is a powerful feature available in STM32 microcontrollers, 
 designed to aid in debugging and performance analysis of embedded systems. It provides a means of capturing and tracing real-time program execution data, such as CPU cycles, instruction execution, and application-specific events.

The ITM module integrates with the ARM Cortex-M core found in STM32 microcontrollers, offering advanced debugging capabilities. It allows developers to instrument their code by inserting trace points at specific locations, which can be triggered to record relevant data during program execution. These trace points can be placed at various levels, ranging from individual instructions to function calls or custom events.
